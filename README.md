# Welcome to the GitHub repository for the RNA sequencing analysis presented in Martell et al. (Citation). 
* This repository contains the codebase used to generate all figures related to the RNAseq analysis, including gene fusions, expression profiles, outlier analysis, and other relevant visualizations.
* This has been tested on
  + R version 4.3.2 (2023-10-31)
  + Platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit)
  + Running under: Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS

## Repository Structure
* Main Script: The core of the analysis is contained in a single R Markdown (RMD) file.
* Configuration File: This file specifies paths and parameters required by the main script. All files must be present and accessible in order for the markdown to run to completion.
* Auxiliary Script: An additional R script is included, which provides extra functions necessary for the analysis.

## Important Notes
* Ensure that all paths specified in the configuration file are correct and  accessible on your system.
* Some of these files are available under the subdirectory ./inputs however 
due to certain constraints/regulations, not all files can be provided directly in this repository. For access to restricted files or further guidance, please reach out to the authors.
